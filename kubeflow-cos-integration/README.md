## Overview

This guide is intended to introduce end users to integration of Kubeflow and COS (Canonical Observability Stack)

<!-- The following should not be on Discourse -->
This repository contains all artifacts needed to support this guide. `graphics/` directory contains all related screenshorts and diagrams. `resources/` directory contains all resources needed to generate this `README.md` and run automated documentation tests. Main documentation which this `README.md` is generated from is in `kubeflow-cos-integration.ipynb`.

## Prerequisites

- Deployed Kubeflow instance, and access to Kubeflow dashboard. For sample Kubeflow deployment refer to https://charmed-kubeflow.io/docs/get-started-with-charmed-kubeflow. More details on Kubeflow can be found here https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/.
- Deployed COS. For deployment of COS refer to https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack/tutorials/install-microk8s
- Familiarity with Python, Jupyter notebooks.
- Minimum system requirements: CPU 8 RAM 32GB DISK 120GB
- Tools: `microk8s`,`juju`, `yq`, `curl`


## Instructions

After deploying Kubeflow and COS there will be two models on the controller - `kubeflow` containing Kubeflow deployment and `cos` containing COS deployment.
Integration with COS involves adding relations to Prometheus to have access to metrics and to Grafana to provide dashboards.
The following components provide built-in sample Grafana dashboards:
- Argo Controller
- Jupyter Notebook Controller
- Seldon Controller Manager

### Prometheus integration

To relate Kubeflow deployment with Prometheus in COS:


```python
juju switch kubeflow
juju add-relation argo-controller admin/cos.prometheus-scrape
juju add-relation dex-auth admin/cos.prometheus-scrape
juju add-relation katib-controller admin/cos.prometheus-scrape
juju add-relation kfp-api admin/cos.prometheus-scrape
juju add-relation metacontroller-operator admin/cos.prometheus-scrape
juju add-relation minio admin/cos.prometheus-scrape
juju add-relation seldon-controller-manager admin/cos.prometheus-scrape
juju add-relation training-operator admin/cos.prometheus-scrape
juju add-relation jupyter-controller admin/cos.prometheus-scrape
```

### Grafana integration

To relate Kubeflow deployment with Grafana in COS:


```python
juju switch kubeflow
juju add-relation jupyter-controller admin/cos.grafana-dashboards
juju add-relation seldon-controller-manager admin/cos.grafana-dashboards
juju add-relation argo-controller admin/cos.grafana-dashboards
```

### Access Prometheus metrics

Follow COS documentation on how to access Prometheus metrics [Browse dashboards](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack/tutorials/install-microk8s) section or obtain IP address using `juju show-unit` command:


```python
juju switch cos
PROMETHEUS_IP=$(juju show-unit prometheus/0 --format yaml | yq .prometheus/0.address)
curl "http://$PROMETHEUS_IP:9090"
```


Navigate to Promethues metrics URL, eg. `http://<prometheus-unit-ip>:9090`. Navigate to **Status**- > **Targets** to see available metrics for various components that were related to Prometheus.

### Access Prometheus alerts

In order to see alerts available for Prometheus, through Prometheus metrics URL, navigate to "Alerts".

![Alerts](./graphics/Alerts.png)

#### List of alerts per Kubeflow component

**Argo Workflows**
Alert | Expression and corresponding Argo Workflow metric | Severity
--- | --- | ---
ArgoWorkflowErrorLoglines | increase(log_messages{level="error"}[2m])  > 10 | Critical
ArgoWorkflowWarningLoglines | increase(log_messages{level="warning"}[2m]) > 40 | Warning
ArgoUnitIsUnavailable | up < 1 | Critical
ArgoWorkflowsErroring | increase( argo_workflows_count{status="Error"}[2m] ) > 1 | Warning
ArgoWorkflowsFailed | increase( argo_workflows_count{status="Failed"}[2m]) > 1 |Warning
ArgoWorkflowsPending | increase( argo_workflows_count{status="Pending"}[2m] ) > 1 | Warning

**Jupyter Notebook Controller**
Alert | Expression and corresponding Jupyter Notebook Controller metric | Severity
--- | --- | ---
UnfinishedWorkQueueAlert | rate(workqueue_unfinished_work_seconds[5m]) >= 100 | Critical
FileDescriptorsExhausted | process_open_fds / process_max_fds >= 0.98 | Critical
FileDescriptorsSoonToBeExhausted | predict_linear((process_open_fds / process_max_fds)[5m:], 60*60) >= 1 |High
JupyterControllerRuntimeReconciliationErrorsExceedThreshold | rate(controller_runtime_reconcile_errors_total[5m]) > 0 | Critical
JupyterControllerUnitIsUnavailable | up < 1| Critical

**Istio Pilot**
Alert | Expression and corresponding Istio Pilot metric | Severity
--- | --- | ---
IstioPilotAvailabilityDrop | avg(avg_over_time(up[1m])) < 0.5 for: 5m | Critical

**Seldon Controller Manager**

Alert | Expression and corresponding Seldon Core Operator metric | Severity
--- | --- | ---
SeldonWorkqueueTooManyRetries | rate(workqueue_retries_total[10m]) > 0 | Critical
SeldonHTTPError | rate(rest_client_requests_total{code=~"4.*"}[10m]) > 0 | Critical
SeldonReconcileError | rate(controller_runtime_reconcile_total{result="error"}[10m]) > 0 | Critical
SeldonUnfinishedWorkIncrease | rate(workqueue_unfinished_work_seconds[10m]) > 0| Critical
SeldonWebhookError | rate(controller_runtime_webhook_requests_total{code="5.*"}[10m]) > 0 | Critical
SeldonUnitIsUnavailable | up < 1 | Critical



### Access Grafana dashboards

Follow COS documentation on how to access Grafana dashboard [Browsed dashboards](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack/tutorials/install-microk8s) section or obtain IP address using `juju show-unit` command:


```python
juju switch cos
GRAFANA_IP=$(juju show-unit grafana/0 --format yaml | yq .grafana/0.address)
curl -f -LI "http://$GRAFANA_IP:3000"
EXTERNAL_IP=$(microk8s kubectl -n cos get svc traefik -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
curl -f -LI "http://$EXTERNAL_IP/cos-grafana-0"
```


Navigate to Grafana dashboard URL, eg. `http://<grafana-unit-ip>:3000` or `http://<external-ip>/cos-grafana-0`

NOTE: If deployed on AWS use the following command to properly set `EXTERNAL_IP` address: `EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl -n cos get svc traefik -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')`

Browse available dashboards by navigating to **Dashboards** -> **Browse**. There should be the following dashboards available:
- ArgoWorkflow Metrics
- Jupyter Notebook Controller
- Seldon Core

#### View metrics in ArgoWorkflow Metrics dashboard

Navigate to "ArgoWorkflow Metrics" dashboard.
Locate Grafana filters at the top of the dashboard and select the following to see the metrics, if required:

- **Juju application** = `argo-controller`

The following metrics are provided (scroll down to see more graphs):
- Number of workflows in error state
- Number of workflows in failed state
- Number of workflows in pending state
- Number of workflows in running state
- Number of workflows in succeded state

- Graph of number of workflow errors alerting
- Histogram of workflow operation duration (not execution time)
- Graph of number of workflow queue adds
- Graph of depth of work queue
- Graph of time objects spent in the queue
- Graph of number of log messages
