    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide is intended to introduce end users to integration of Kubeflow and COS (Canonical Observability Stack)\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- The following should not be on Discourse -->\n",
    "This repository contains all artifacts needed to support this guide. `graphics/` directory contains all related screenshorts and diagrams. `resources/` directory contains all resources needed to generate this `README.md` and run automated documentation tests. Main documentation which this `README.md` is generated from is in `kubeflow-cos-integration.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deployed Kubeflow instance, and access to Kubeflow dashboard. For sample Kubeflow deployment refer to https://charmed-kubeflow.io/docs/get-started-with-charmed-kubeflow. More details on Kubeflow can be found here https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/.\n",
    "- Deployed COS. For deployment of COS refer to https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack/tutorials/install-microk8s\n",
    "- Familiarity with Python, Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "- Minimum system requirements: CPU 8 RAM 32GB DISK 120GB\n",
    "- Tools: `microk8s`,`juju`, `yq`, `curl`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "After deploying Kubeflow and COS there will be two models on the controller - `kubeflow` containing Kubeflow deployment and `cos` containing COS deployment.\n",
    "Integration with COS involves adding relations to Prometheus to have access to metrics and to Grafana to provide dashboards.\n",
    "The following components provide built-in sample Grafana dashboards:\n",
    "- Argo Controller\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook Controller\n",
    "- Seldon Controller Manager\n",
